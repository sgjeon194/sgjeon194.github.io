  I am a Ph.D student at Korea University ECE (Electronic & Computer Engineering) advised by [Jeongseob Ahn](https://jeongseob.github.io/). 
  My current main interests are about accelerating AI systems and architectures.

  
  Before joining [CSL@KU](https://sites.google.com/korea.ac.kr/csl/home?authuser=0), I received my Bachelor and M.S degree in Ajou University CSE (Computer Science & Engineering), 
  and I worked as a Computer Graphics programmer & project leader at the military service of Republic of Korea Army.
